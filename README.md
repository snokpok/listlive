# Listlive: Making Productivity Social
This is a MVP for an idea I had to make todo lists a more enjoyable process. With many apps now offering social functionalities and features e.g Discord's Presence, Spotify Friends' Activity, etc... we seem to love a bit of human presence over the sophisticated network called the Internet. Listlive follows up this trend where you can now share your daily productivity grinds for others to have a peek every once in a while. It keeps you accounted for completing those tasks as well, because the worst thing that can happen is you turning deadlines into DEAD-lines
